# README

QC Automation is automated for targeted data
[QC_Automation.Rmd](https://github.com/byandell/metabr/blob/master/QC_Automation.Rmd).
Key routine is [qc_steps.R](https://github.com/byandell/metabr/blob/master/R/qc_steps.R).
Still to do is examine untargeted data.

Not clear yet how this will generalize to DO data.
